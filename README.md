# A Word Story
*A Word Story* is a platform to practice writing and connect with other writers by writing, sharing, and reading daily stories that are based on given daily words.


Each day, a new word is generated and is made the prompt for that day and it is your job to flex your creative muscles and write a short story based around this word. After you finish, you'll share it with the community either anonymously or under your profile.


All of these stories function as bridges between writers that allow for feedback to be given/received and for connections to be made.


Writing daily is very important to us because it does such a good job of solidifying writing fundamentals and practicing creative thinking. This combined with the random word prompt will challenge your creativity and will most likely lead to stories that you might not care for. However, the idea isn't to write perfect stories but rather to keep on writing and keep on receiving feedback.


Even if you don't write, or if you just want to take a break from writing, you can enjoy the daily stories generated by other users and see how each individual tackled the same prompt differently. After reading, you can rate stories and leave comments to encourage other writers to keep on honing their skills.


Cool, right? Head on over to the 'Write' tab to start writing, the 'Community' tab to start reading, or the 'Profile' tab to make an account!
